                    <div class="answer">This website is a tool for drilling commutators and algorithms for blindsolving.
                        Instead of relying on seeing cases in real solves, you select specific cases you want to
                        practice. This way you can effectively and efficiently practice all cases, but especially the
                        rare or difficult ones. The proper use of this website will significantly decrease your recall
                        speed and make you more confident</div>

                    <div class="question">How to sync (export/import) my data?</div>
                    <div class="answer">To sync data between device, just open the sync popup on the landing page and click "export" to export your local data to a database, or "import" to import it back to your device.<br>Your data will be stored together with a unique ID, which is automatically generated and displayed in the same popup. However you can change it, which is used to have the same ID on two different devices. Once you have the same ID saved on all the devices you will use, you will only have to click import or export.

                    <div class="question">What is a preset?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A preset is a way to store selected pieces, usually ones you practice
                        often.<br>Select all the cases you want to store and click "set" next to the preset you want to
                        store the cases in. When you want to practice these cases, simply click the preset you stored
                        them in and the case will be selected for you. You can double click the preset to change its
                        name and click reset to delete the cases stored inside it.<br>Presets are stored in your
                        browser's local storage, as well as in a database if you have an account.</div>

                <div class="questionBox">
                    <div class="question">What is a slow preset?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A slow preset is a collection of your slowest cases based on your practice
                        sessions. It is individually stored for each category and each floating buffer and is
                        automatically updated after each practice session.<br>In the settings, you can adjust the
                        maximum amount of cases stored as well as the maximum time a case can have in order to be
                        stored. Limiting this time is useful, because it prevents the website from storing cases that
                        have a high time due to being away from your device for example. You can reset all slow presets
                        in the main settings.</div>

                    <div class="question">How to use custom letter scheme?</div>
                    <div class="answer">In the main settings, there are 2 input fields. The first one, saying "Corner scheme here", is for the corner scheme and the second one, "Edge scheme here", is for the edge scheme.<br>
                    Corner scheme is used for: Corners, Twists, parts of Parity, LTCT, Words, Xcenters<br>
                    Edge scheme is used for: Edges, parts of Parity, Wings, Midges, +centers<br>
                    Enter your 24 letters without spaces in the 2 fields and click "Save". The order in which you must input them is important. The order is A to X according to the speffz scheme, which is:<br>
                    Corners: UBL UBR UFR UFL LUB LUF LDF LDB FUL FUR FDR FDL RUF RUB RDB RFD BUR BUL BDL BDR DFL DFR DBR DBL<br>

                    <div class="answer">You can change your buffer by opening the piecetype settings and double clicking
                        whatever buffer you want to practice. You can rearrange them to your preferred order with
                        drag-and-drop.</div>

                        0 means no breaks.<br>"Target time" -> The time (in seconds) that you want each case to be
                        under. Cases that were above the target time can be practiced again after each
                        session.<br>"Amount of cases" -> The maximum amount of cases you want to have saved in the slow
                        presets.<br>"Max time" -> The slowest time (in seconds) allowed to put into the slow cases. This
                        can be used to prevent cases from being stored when the time was high for external reasons, eg.
                        you had to leave your device.<br>"Include inverse cases" -> Selecting this will include the
                        inverses of the cases you selected, eg. selecting AG will also include GA for the practice
                        session.<br>"Show next letterpair" -> This feature shows the next letterpair (or case) under the
                        current one. This can be used to more accurately simulate real solves, where you know the next
                        letterpair while executing the current one.</div>
